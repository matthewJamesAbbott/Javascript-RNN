About the Project

This project aims to demonstrate the workings of a Multi-Layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a type of neural network capable of processing sequential data and learning temporal dependencies. It is designed to be lightweight, browser-friendly, and accessible—making it an excellent learning tool for beginners and enthusiasts exploring sequence modeling.

Built With

HTML: For the user interface.

JavaScript: For the implementation of RNN algorithms, including recurrent connections, forward propagation, and backpropagation through time.

Features

Fully configurable multi-layer RNN with multiple hidden layers.

Interactive network creation: set input size, hidden layer sizes, output size, and learning rate.

Load training data via CSV upload or pasting sequences directly into the browser.

Train the network in-browser with immediate feedback on predictions versus targets.

Predict sequences dynamically and display results in a readable table.

Save and load network models as JSON for reuse and experimentation.

Lightweight, self-contained, and runs entirely in your browser—no backend required.
